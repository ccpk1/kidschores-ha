[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable all checks - Ruff and MyPy handle linting
disable=all

# KidsChores Architecture Notes (v0.5.0+):
# - W0212:protected-access - Intentional: Managers access coordinator._data and _persist()
# - W0613:unused-argument - Signal handlers require payload parameter (signal signature)
# - W0718:broad-exception-caught - Allowed in background tasks per HA guidelines
# - W0612:unused-variable - Some unused vars are OK in specific contexts
# - C0302:too-many-lines - chore_manager.py is complex but necessary for orchestration
#
# Rather than suppress individually, we disable pylint entirely in IDE since:
# 1. Ruff is primary linter (configured in quick_lint.sh)
# 2. MyPy is primary type checker (integrated in quick_lint.sh)
# 3. Pylint is only used for additional validation in CI/CD
#
# To enable pylint checks again, remove this file or update this list.
