"""Tests for pending approvals consolidation in dashboard helper sensor.

Focuses on:
- Pending approvals data structure and button entity lookups
- Auto-approve exclusion logic
- State updates when chores are claimed and approved

Note: These are simplified to test the coordinator's pending approvals data
structures without requiring full scenario setup. Complex integration tests
are covered in test_workflow_* files.
