# Scenario: Shadow Kid Link Service Testing (Stårblüm Family)
# Purpose: Test manage_shadow_link service for linking/unlinking existing profiles
#
# Characters (Stårblüm-compliant names):
# - Parent "Astrid" (Mom Astrid, no shadow kid, allow_chore_assignment=False)
# - Kid "Astrid" (regular kid with points and chores - matches parent name)
# - Parent "Leo" (Dad Leo, has shadow kid, allow_chore_assignment=True)
# - Kid "Leo" (shadow kid auto-created and linked to parent Leo)
# - Kid "Zoë" (regular kid, no matching parent name)
#
# Test cases enabled:
# 1. Link matching names: Astrid parent + Astrid kid
# 2. Link errors: kid not found, parent not found
# 3. Link already shadow: Leo kid already linked
# 4. Link parent has different shadow: Leo parent already has shadow Leo
# 5. Unlink success: Leo shadow kid → Leo_unlinked
# 6. Unlink data preservation: All points/chores preserved
# 7. Unlink non-shadow error: Astrid kid is not shadow
