"""Test badge period structure initialization and signal flow.

Tests the Landlord-Tenant pattern for badge earned period tracking:
- GamificationManager (Landlord) creates empty periods: {} before emitting signal
- StatisticsManager (Tenant) populates period data via record_transaction

These tests verify the ACTUAL BUG that was found in production:
- Bronze badge was awarded with periods: {} (empty dict)
- Signal was not emitted OR handler was not triggered OR record_transaction failed
- This file tests each step of the flow to isolate the root cause

Uses scenario_full (Stårblüm family) from test_badge_helpers.py pattern.
