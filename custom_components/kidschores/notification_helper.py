# File: notification_helper.py
"""Sends notifications using Home Assistant's notify services.

This module implements a helper for sending notifications in the KidsChores integration.
It supports sending notifications via Home Assistant’s notify services (HA Companion notifications)
and includes an optional payload of actions. For actionable notifications, you must encode extra
context (like kid_id and chore_id) directly into the action string.
All texts and labels are referenced from constants.
